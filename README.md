Scripts to convert Cambium cnMaestro images for Xen

I used to use these to convert and load cnmaestro local instance images for booting on Xen servers. Cambium didn't distribute anything for Xen so I put these together.

I'm no longer in the wireless ISP business so I figured I'd share them while cleaning up old stuff for deletion.
